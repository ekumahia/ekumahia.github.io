					<p>
					DJs flock by when MTV ax quiz prog. Junk MTV quiz graced by fox whelps. Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs. Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex! Fox nymphs grab quick-jived waltz. Brick quiz whangs jumpy veldt fox. Bright vixens jump&#59; dozy fowl quack. Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim. Sex-charged fop blew my junk TV quiz. How quickly daft jumping zebras vex. Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz. Quick, Baz, get my woven flax jodhpurs! &ldquo;Now fax quiz Jack!&rdquo; my brave ghost pled. Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed. Flummoxed by job, kvetching W. zaps Iraq. Cozy sphinx waves quart jug of bad milk.

					<h2> Few Quips galvanized </h2>
					<p>
					Few quips galvanized the mock jury box. Quick brown dogs jump over the lazy fox. The jay, pig, fox, zebra, and my wolves quack! Blowzy red vixens fight for a quick jump. Joaquin Phoenix was gazed by MTV for luck. A wizard&#39;s job is to vex chumps quickly in fog. Watch &ldquo;Jeopardy!&rdquo;, Alex Trebek&#39;s fun TV quiz game. Woven silk pyjamas exchanged for blue quartz. Brawny gods just flocked up to quiz and vex him. Adjusting quiver and bow, Zompyc[1] killed the fox. My faxed joke won a pager in the cable TV quiz show. Amazingly few discotheques provide jukeboxes. My girl wove six dozen plaid jackets before she quit. Six big devils from Japan quickly forgot how to waltz.

					<h2> There was a riot in the streets. </h2>
					<p> There was a riot in the streets tell me where were you? You were sittin home watching your TV, while I was participating in some anarchy. First spot we hit was my liquor store, finally got all that alcohol I can't afford. With red lights flashin&#39;, time to retire, And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire.
					Next stop we hit, it was the music shop, It only took one brick to make the window drop. Finally we got our own P.A.;Where do you think I got this guitar that you&#39;re hearing today? Ay?

					<h2> Valar Morghulis </h2>
					<p> Valar Dohaeris. Felger and Mazz. Gresh and Zo. Dear Prudence came in through the bathroom window, and her bird could sing something wild, honey pie. If I fell Dr. Robert, let it be fixing a hole. Get back to the long and winding road across the universe.</p>
