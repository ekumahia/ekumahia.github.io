	<h3> About Me:</h3>
	<p1> My name is Elike Kumahia (Ah-Lee-Ka Koom-A-He-Ya) and this is my webpage! I was born in Boston on June, 11 1990, the last of my parents 3 sons. We moved to Randolph, MA when I was two and have lived there since. I grew up playing sports and music, and both continue to be passions to this day. I graduated from Williams in 2012 studying History and Africana Studies. Since graduating Iâ€™ve volunteered, interned and worked at a range of places and am now working on becoming well versed in Front-End.</p1>
