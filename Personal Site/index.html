	<h3> About Me:</h3>
	<p1> Elike Kumahia [ pronounced Ah-Lee-Ka Koom-A-He-Ya]. This is my webpage. I was born in Boston on June, 11 1990, the last of my parents 3 sons. We moved to Randolph, MA when I was two and have lived there since. I grew up playing sports and music, and both continue to be passions to this day. I graduated from Williams in 2012 studying History and Africana Studies. Since graduating Iâ€™ve volunteered, interned and worked at a range of places and am now working on becoming well versed in Front-End Web Dev. On my site you'll find examples of some of the projects I've been working on, professionally and in leisure. </p1>
